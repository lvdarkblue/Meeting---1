MISSION 1: MAZE ESCAPE

Pac-Man is trapped inside a digital maze.

Your objective:
- Explore all folders and subfolders
- Open and read the files carefully
- Some files contain useful information, others are decoys
- Extract the escape code fragments hidden inside the text
- Combine all fragments into ONE escape code

When you believe you have the correct code:

Create a file named escape_code.txt and place the final code inside it.

Create escape_code.txt in the main directory, not inside any folder such as maze1/ or INSTRUCTIONS.txt
