Ghost Diary — Sector A

Blinky was here earlier, pacing the maze endlessly.
The walls seem tighter every time Pac-Man passes through.

Strange note scribbled on the corner of the page:

The escape sequence starts with **PAC**, but this alone
won’t open the maze.

More fragments must exist somewhere else.

End of diary entry.
